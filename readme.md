In 2021, I initialized a course with teach students from the principle and composition of CPU / ALU to the myth behind the AlphaGo and Quantum Computing. 

I want to help ingenious students have a solid background and vision for computer science, not merely some programming ability. 

This course is finished, but the structure and content will be updated continuely. 

If you're interested some topics but there are not in this repo. Please add an issue.
